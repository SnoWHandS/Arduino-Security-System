Arduino-Security-System
=======================

All my Arduino source code for use with an Arduino Mega built into a home security system

This repository introduces the prototype for a new kind of alarm system. The security system titled “Heald Security” is designed to be highly configurable allowing the user to decide what their security system must control and do. The flexibility of the Heald Security system will allow the user who implements the system to control anything the he/she wishes; from garage doors opened by RFID  tags under the cars to turning off all the lights when the alarm is armed.
The Heald Security System implements the power and flexibility of the Arduino  Mega microcontroller at its core. Using this platform allows the user to easily create new modules.
